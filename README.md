# FCCF-PCR
Feature-Consistent Coplane-Pair Correspondence- and Fusion-Based Point Cloud Registration (2023) by  Kuo-Liang Chung, Pei-Hsuan Hsieh, and Chia-Chi Hsu.
## Usage
Compiling by following code in the project directory
```
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..; make;
```
then we can get transformation matrix of source and target point cloud by
```
./FCCF {PATH_TO_SRC_CLOUD} {PATH_TO_TAR_CLOUD} {VOXEL_GRID_SIZE}
```
## Testing enviroment
* Windows Subsystem Linux(Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS)
* ISO C++ 14
